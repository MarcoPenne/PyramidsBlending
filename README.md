# PyramidsBlending
 Use of image pyramid to blend two images so that it appear to be natural

## Usage

To use the blending script you have to provide the two images to blend. The script will ask you to draw a mask
```bash
python3 blending.py path/to/first/image path/to/second/image
```

If you already have a mask you can use it providing it as a third argument
```bash
python3 blending.py path/to/first/image path/to/second/image path/to/mask
```
